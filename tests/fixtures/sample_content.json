We'll cover three main types: supervised learning where we learn with examples like a teacher showing flashcards, unsupervised learning where we find hidden patterns like organizing a messy room, and reinforcement learning where we learn through trial and error like learning to ride a bike. Then I'll walk you through building a simple prediction model using Python that can actually make predictions on real data.",
